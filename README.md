Introduction:
I found the dataset online. I was intrigued how rich it was. It has over 8400 rows and 25 columns. So it is a retail data analysis project of one of the big retailer in the USA: Walmart
Tableau concept applied here: Parameters, Bins , data modelling.

Problem Statement:
It is all about finding the trend for different regions and states. Show the insights about profit, sales and discount on different areas.
1-	Trend state VS Profit
2-	Distribution of average profit by states(which state generate more profit)
3-	What is the more profitable age range?
4-	What is the average sales, profit and discount?

Data sourcing:
I have got the data online and I uploaded the data for a better understanding.
